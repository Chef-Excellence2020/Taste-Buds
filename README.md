## Overview
### Description
A recipe app that focuses on collaborative creation. Users can suggest alternative or replacement ingredients and instructions that are adopted into the recipe once approved.  This allows others with dietary concerns and those looking for different flavors more accessibility to more recipes.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Food
- **Mobile:**  The app will be created with mobile in mind, but could easily be adapted for web browsers if successful.
- **Story:** Allows users to build upon each others' recipes by commenting novel approaches that can then be intigrated into the original recipe.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app can be used by people who are looking for more options and freedom for their cooking. Cooks with special dietary concerns could also suggest alternative ingredients to existing meals to give others more options.
- **Scope:** After the base features are implemented, it will be important to create organization features that allow people to seek out specific recipes based on their needs. For example, if a suggestion makes a recipe gluten free, then the recipe needs to be updated in a way that it is findable by those looking for gluten free recipes.
